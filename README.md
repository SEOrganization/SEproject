A project for the software course required us to create Cleaning services for carpets and covers:
required features:
The Idea is to build management system that can:
1. record full information for customers (e.g. name , phone, address, etc..).
2. record full information for the product (e.g. name, picture, description[dimension,
material) , is required special treatment, etc..)
3. generate invoice for customer including delivery information price , address , items he
give to clean
4. generate customized reports about business.
5. Track the orders and the status [ waiting, in treatment, complete]
6. Give a discount option to customers based on your design option, for example if the
customer frequently uses the service with an amount of money >400 NIS, he can get a
10% discount. Please feel free to set an acceptable discount rate.
7. Generate statistics about, for example, total delivered items , total cash , total paid, total
debts.
8. Distribute the orders on the available workers.
9. Notify the customer by sending email when the order is complete.
And this is report to show all result:
